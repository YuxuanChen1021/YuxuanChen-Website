        <div class="subheading mb-5">SociologyüßÅ</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current freshman student at the University of California, Riverside. I am also a sociology major. I have participated in a sociological study on adolescent procrastination, going to investigate whether students of different ages procrastinate and why. I visited a sample of middle schools high schools and colleges with my mentor and interviewed students about why they procrastinate and procrastinate. After doing a big data analysis based on the time given by each school for students to submit their assignments. I also wrote my own article about my understanding of procrastination. This is a sociological study that I participated in. I used to do research about hair loss, about why people lose their hair initiating doubts to come up with oil clogging in hair follicles. All of these activities have given me a different experience of human relationships. There are good things and bad things that happen to people. This is what made me want to study sociology.<br><br>

        I also did a month-long internship at Citibank. I learned about risk assessment, insurance, stocks, futures and other concepts. At the end of my internship, I was able to place stocks and invest in insurance funds for real Citi clients. I worked with three clients in different situations, providing them with critical illness insurance, pension insurance and savings and dividend insurance according to their individual family situations. I have gained a lot from this, which is why I chose sociology. I think the root of sociology is people, and there is nothing in society that does not have something to do with people. So I want to understand society from sociology. There are different kinds of people from different countries and different races. They are all different. I am looking forward to continue studying sociology.<br><br>

        I also participated in many competitions in high school and served as a team captain. For example, Nec, USAD, and other competitions. I learned how to get along with people and how to integrate everyone's opinions. Harvard Summit was the most interesting program for me. I volunteered in it, learning and managing the order of the students at the same time. It was a way for me to practice my skills. I enjoyed being very busy, but very fulfilling inside. I feel that my management skills have improved a lot. I also went to the mountains to teach Chinese classes. I taught simple ancient poems and texts to the children left behind. I saw the most precious innocence and kindness of human nature. This gave me a different perspective on sociology. My grades are not considered excellent, only moderate in high school. However, now I want to work hard to complete both my classwork and my internship. Personally, I am a person who likes food very much. It is my dream to eat all the delicious food in the world. I think it is a happy time to eat good food. I hope my future work can also be related to food. This is my resume.
